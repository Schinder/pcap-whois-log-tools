# pcap-whois-log-tools
This repo is a set of tools I use to start packet logging on my web server, then cut the logs for the IP addresses of who contacted me, then perform whois lookups on those addresses, and neatly place all of this data into a directory for later review (all named with the date the log was created).  There is room for future work here.  For example, the logging currently contines into the next day and I need to manually kill the process for the previous day's pcap - which is a bit of a pain.  I'll update this as I am able, folks.
